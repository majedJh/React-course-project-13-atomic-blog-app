# React Atomic blog App

A project I did while following the tutorial of [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/)

## App functionality

It's a blog app that allows the user to surf between different posted blogs, search for a blog using a certain keyword. it also allowes the user to post some blog, and check the archived posts. The user can also toggle the light mode.

## How it is done

It generates blogs using the faker haker API

## What I learned

I learned one of the most important concepts in React, which is Context; I learned how and when to use it; especially when handling remote global UI states so I can fix the prob drilling issue. I used the createcontext element, the useContext hook, then created a custom hook that always gets the state from the same provider.
